				<h2>Our History</h2>
				<img src="../images/shirt.jpg" alt="image of a shirt" />
				<p>
					Everyone knows hip-hop fashion when they see it, but it is becoming
					increasingly more difficult to define. One can point to a specific
					rapper or era, but it never captures the entire picture. As hip-hop
					has moved into the mainstream, the lines are blurred between what is
					and is not considered hip-hop. Yet there is an underlying idea that
					explains the progression and evolution of hip-hop style: It’s all
					about attitude.
				</p>
				<p>
					Hip-hop is not only a genre of music, a form of dance, or a way of
					dressing. Hip-hop is a culture. Emerging from the Bronx in New York
					City, the hip-hop lifestyle – with its music, DJing, dancing and
					graffiti – provided an escape from a myriad of societal, economic,
					political, and cultural forces.

				<h2>Our People</h2>
				<div>
					<h3>Run , MC</h3>
					<img src="../images/mc.jpg" alt="image of run dmc" />
					<p>
						The group most responsible for establishing and defining hip hop’s
						trademark “street” look was Run-DMC, who famously adopted Adidas
						tracksuits and laceless shell-toed sneakers as their signature
						uniform. This look was inspired by the style of New York City b-boys
						at the time. By adopting this street look, the group rejected the
						highly glamorous looks of early hip hop — such as those of Afrika
						Bambaataa and DJ Grandmaster Flash — in favor of a grittier
						(although still flashy) look.
					</p>

				<div>
					<h3>LL Cool J , MC</h3>
					<img src="../images/llcool.jpg" alt="image of ll cool j" />
					<p>
						Hip Hop culture is something dear to LL Cool J being a long-standing
						act in the music industry. Cool J states over our Zoom call, “since
						I started, fashion, and specifically streetwear, has always been
						something that I loved. I just felt like there’s room. People want
						something flavorful, but they want it to be from the people that
						really built [street] culture. A lot of people are playing in the
						streetwear game when the reality is there are a lot of outsiders
						playing in the culture.”
